MAP

EVERYTHING SUBJECT TO CHANGE

TileType
	The type of tile
	Currently only 2 types, more can be added
	May remove this in favor of something else

MapBehaviour
	Base class for all maps
	Scene needs exactly one of these to Function

	Static Members:
		Other classes will interact with the map via these functions
		If you need something not available, ask whoever is in charge of this and he/she will implement a static method for it

	Abstract Methods:
		BuildMap() - Construct map. Called once at start of a scene
		GetPathForCreep() - a path for a creep to follow. 
							Will be called once for each creep, so try to be efficient
							This allows for multiple paths.
							Each step in path must be horizontal or vertical (no diagonal) and have a distance of 1

MapGizmoDrawer
	Draws the map in scene view.
	Will not show up in gameplay
	Requires map to have ExecuteInEditModeAttribute if you want to see it without entering play mode



To create a new map/algorithm, derive from MapBehavior.
	Include attributes (optional, but highly recomended):
		AddComponentMenu("Map/{name}") - groups all map behaviours together for easier navigation
		ExecuteInEditMode - If you want map to be updated in editor.  Useful with MapGizmoDrawer

	Implement:
		BuildMap() - This can be a predetermined map, or a randomly generated one.
		GetPathForCreep() - Do not generate new path every time. Cache it. Will be called frequently.
